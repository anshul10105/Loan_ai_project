## About the Project
This project is a Loan Prediction API built using FastAPI and scikit-learn that predicts whether a loan will be approved based on inputs such as income, credit score, and loan amount. A machine learning model is trained locally and saved as a pickle file, which is loaded by the API to provide real-time predictions. The API runs using Uvicorn and includes interactive documentation through Swagger UI at /docs. Users can send a POST request to the /predict endpoint with JSON input to receive the loan approval decision and confidence score. This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow including model training, API development, local testing, and GitHub-based version control.
